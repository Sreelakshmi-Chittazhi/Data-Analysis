## Research Question 
 ## How well a hybrid model can incorporate weather forecast data and market prices topredict energy imbalances for prosumers more effectively?
 ## Research Objectives
 Following are the key research objectives:
 - Conduct exploratory data analysis on the data.
 - Feature ExtractioN
 - Implement the base models (Light Gradient Boosting Regressor and Random Forest
 Regressor).
 - Implement the hybrid model by stacking the base models using a meta model.

 The current study seeks to contribute to the solution of the problem related to
 the determination of imbalance in prosumer networks, as this is critical for increas
ing the efficiency of energy management, and therefore, for decreasing the reliance
 on traditional power supply. This problem is relevant because the appropriate
 energy management contributes to improvement of energy systems, the reduction
 of carbon emissions, and the availability and stability of energy supply. To ad
dress this, developed a hybrid model that integrates the weather data and market
 price data with advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the predictions
 of energy imbalance.Eventhough the base model LightGBM model(18.15) and hy
brid model with meta models linear regression and ridge regression had similar
 MAE value (18.20) which suggest its effectiveness in managing energy imbalances
 in prosumer networks. 

 ## Objective :
 The main goal of this research is to predict the energy behaviour of prosumers. By
 predicting both energy consumption and production accurately, the model can help in
 mitigating the energy imbalances that cause operational and financial challenges for en
ergy companies.The study seeks to combine the weather data and market prices into a
 hybrid model combining machine learning algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy and
 provide better insights into the factors influencing prosumer behavior
